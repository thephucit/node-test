/**
 * Actually, I have never worked with Shopify and AWS before.
 * With limited knowledge about it, I have found the solution through this article by Mike Potter https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/shopify-webhooks-how-to-prep-your-app-this-black-friday-cyber-monday.
 * From what I understood is: Shopify Webhook -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> SQS.
 * Hopefully, I can join Boostcommerce to have a chance to learn and improve these knowledge.
 * Thank you for taking the time to go through my solutions.
